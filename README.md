## Supply Chain Forecasting and Optimization

This repository contains an end‑to‑end workflow for **demand forecasting and optimization in a supply chain context**, implemented as a sequence of Jupyter notebooks. It covers data loading and validation, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and modeling with both LSTM and XGBoost.

### Repository structure

- **`01_data_loading_and_validation.ipynb`**: Loads the raw supply chain dataset, performs basic cleaning, handles missing values, validates data types and ranges, and saves a cleaned/validated version of the data for downstream steps.
- **`02_eda.ipynb`**: Exploratory data analysis of the cleaned dataset, including univariate and multivariate summaries, time series behavior, seasonal patterns, and relationships between key operational variables.
- **`03_feature_engineering.ipynb`**: Creates modeling features such as time‑based lags, rolling statistics, categorical encodings, and any domain‑specific transformations used by the forecasting models.
- **`04_lstm_model.ipynb`**: Builds and trains an LSTM‑based deep learning model for time‑series forecasting, including train/validation splits, model architecture, training loops, and evaluation metrics.
- **`05_xgboost_model.ipynb`**: Trains an XGBoost‑based model using the engineered features as an alternative or benchmark to the LSTM approach.
- **`data/` (ignored in git)**: Expected location for raw data files such as `supply_chain_dataset1.csv`. This folder is intentionally excluded from version control; you should place your own data here.

### Data

- **Input data**: The notebooks expect a supply chain dataset (for example, `data/supply_chain_dataset1.csv`) containing the historical observations used for forecasting.
- **Validated data**: A cleaned/validated dataset (for example, `supply_chain_validated.csv`) may be generated by `01_data_loading_and_validation.ipynb` and reused by later notebooks.
- **Git ignore**: The `data/` directory is ignored by `.gitignore`, so datasets are not committed to the repository by default. You will need to provide the data locally before running the notebooks.

### Environment setup

1. **Install Python**
   - Use **Python 3.9+**.

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # Windows (PowerShell)
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   # Or, Windows (cmd)
   .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   If you have a `requirements.txt` file, run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Otherwise, install commonly used libraries for this workflow:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost tensorflow jupyter
   ```

### Running the notebooks

1. Place your input dataset(s) in the `data/` directory (for example, `data/supply_chain_dataset1.csv`).
2. Start Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   # or
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open and run the notebooks in order:
   1. `01_data_loading_and_validation.ipynb`
   2. `02_eda.ipynb`
   3. `03_feature_engineering.ipynb`
   4. `04_lstm_model.ipynb`
   5. `05_xgboost_model.ipynb`

Running them sequentially ensures that each later notebook can reuse the outputs (such as cleaned data and engineered features) generated in the previous steps.

### Modeling overview

- **LSTM model** (`04_lstm_model.ipynb`):
  - Sequence modeling for time‑series demand forecasting.
  - Suitable for capturing temporal dependencies, trends, and seasonality.

- **XGBoost model** (`05_xgboost_model.ipynb`):
  - Gradient‑boosted trees on engineered features.
  - Often used as a strong baseline or complementary model alongside deep learning approaches.

You can compare the models on metrics such as MAE, MAPE, RMSE, or others defined in the notebooks and choose the most appropriate for your supply chain use case.

### Reproducibility and extensions

- **Random seeds**: If you want strict reproducibility, ensure seeds are set for NumPy, TensorFlow, and XGBoost where appropriate.
- **Hyperparameter tuning**: You can extend the modeling notebooks with grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization for better performance.
- **Operational integration**: The modeling outputs can be integrated into downstream optimization or planning tools (e.g., safety stock calculation, replenishment policies, scenario analysis).


**Repo Updates often!!**
